<!--    ABOUT US  -->
        <div class = "about-us">
            <h2>About us:</h2>
            <p>Aquayard was founded by Mr. Madhusudana Rao who has over 20 years of experience in the water treatment industry. After successfully installing over 7000 water purifiers for the government of Andhra Pradesh under the vision of the Honorable Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh Mr. Y.S Jagan Mohan Reddy. We also worked for APIIC, ONGC, APSWREIS, APMSIDC, APTRANSCO, APGENCO, LIKITHA, and Puttaparthi Sri Satya Sai organization. After gaining solid work experience, we began manufacturing Custom Water Purifiers, where the front panel and the other parts of the water purifier can be customized to meet the needs of domestic and commercial purposes, while at the same time maintaining high standards for our products. In response to the growing scarcity of groundwater, we began using newly emerging technologies including CDI, which has a maximum water loss of 20%. We also supply spare parts for water purifications systems. Our services are currently only available in Andhra Pradesh, but we plan to expand to other states soon.</p>
